# [M - 1143. Longest Common Subsequence]([link](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-subsequence/description/))

`Topics: String, Dynamic Programming`

Given two strings `text1` and `text2`, return the length of their longest common subsequence. If there is no **common subsequence**, return `0`.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

For example, `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"`.
A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.


 
 ```java
Example 1:

Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" 
Output: 3  
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
Example 2:

Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.
Example 3:

Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.
 

Constraints:

1 <= text1.length, text2.length <= 1000
text1 and text2 consist of only lowercase English characters.
```
## [Solution 1: ](link)

### Idea
- If Mismatch letter, max(Up, Left)
- If Match letter, 1 + diagonal

![alt text](/img/1143.png)

### Complexity
**TC /SC:**
`O(text1 length * text2 length)`

### Code
```java
class Solution {

                                        /*
    Mismatch letter max(Up, Left)
    a  b
    c (*)      (*) = max(b,c) 

    Match letter // 1 + diagonal
    a b
    c (*)       (*) = 1 + a
                                        */

    public int longestCommonSubsequence(String text1, String text2) {
        int[][] dp = new int[text1.length()+1][text2.length()+1];
        for(int i = 1 ; i < dp.length; ++i){
            for (int j = 1; j < dp[0].length; ++j){
                if (text1.charAt(i-1) != text2.charAt(j-1))
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]);  
                else
                    dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i-1][j-1];
            }
        }
        return dp[dp.length-1][dp[0].length-1];
    }
}
```


### Additional : Reconstruct LCS from the dp table
```java
StringBuilder lcs = new StringBuilder();
int row = s1.length(), col = s2.length();
while(row > 0 && col > 0){
    if(s1.charAt(row-1) == s2.charAt(col-1)){
        lcs.append(s1.charAt(row-1));
        row--;
        col--;
    else if (dp[row-1][col] > dp[row][col-1])
        row--;
    else
        col--; 
  }

return lcs.reverse().toString(); // since it was built backwards.
```
